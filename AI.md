Hi!
I need a modern web page about personal finances, with modern animations and effects, with files index.html, style.css and script.js for this page and data.json with a group of data within references and description to sites, persons, videos e documents about personal finance, so the user can search for words and the page using script.js will filter the data.json via fetch js function and show results that match with it. Can you do that for me, please?
```

```
Wow! Great! But I can also have users from pt-BR, can you create a button to translate and alternate this site between pt-BR and en-US, as well as a data_pt-BR.json with pt-BR data about finances like data.json has this data in en-US, please?
```

```
Very good!
Can now replace the green background of header with a yang business man in a modern office, with a glass behind he write "Pole Finances" and a modern favicon.ico for this site, please?
```

```
Can you expand this image, keeping it on the left and expanding the office to the right to achieve a 4K resolution width, please?
```

```
Thanks a lot!
Now can you replace the green background of header with this image?
```

```
It's working!
Now can you generate a favicon.png like a bag full of coins and banknote, some of this outside?
```
- PS: favicon.png image was edited with GIMP to get a transparent background, and also header background edited to remove a grave accent from Pole word.

When I search for "youtube", I got nothing, can you fix this, please?
```

```
Can you put abou the result, the number of articles filtered?
```

```
When a open the site, or search field is blank, a cannot see the result count, can you fix this, please?
```

```
Greate job! Now I need a button to add a card, open a form in a modal popup to do it, with cancel and save buttons. And also a trash button to remove a card, inside each card at to right, asking confirmation before revome it.
```

```
Awesome! The data does not have been saved on data_pt-BR.json or data.json, can you add this feature to save the  form data in its respective file?
```

```
Very good! Now I need to update a card some times, can you create a update button just with circular arrows instead of text, bellow delete button, and open a form to update and save like when I add a new card, please?
```
```
Fantastic! A little fix: when I adding a new card, the green button is "Update" instead of "Add". Can you fix this, please?
```

```
Excelent! I also need a resource to export the combined json from server and local, with the total data showing for me when viewing all cards, can you add this button beside left of green add button, please?
```

```
You did a wonderful job! I missed having a floating button to return to the top. Could you please add one in the screen on the right side?
```

```
Great! Now I realized that misspelling a letter compromises the search. Is there a way to search by similarity and disregard accents instead of searching for the exact word? Can you do that, please?
```

```
Very well done! Now I want to give to user share your cards, so can you change "Export JSON" button to "My cards" menu button, with a down arrow, then the user will get the option to share by e-mail, whatsapp, telegran, etc, also import or export, please?
```

```
Hummm... I thing there is a problem with css, can you fix it?
```

```
Great!
But I found a bug: when I filter a word and then edit or delete a card, the filter result doesn't change, the cards are restored, but if I reload the page, the changes take effect. Can you fix this?
```

```
Solved! When I import JSON I want to add cards, not replace, just replace or update if the title is the same, but for each case, request a confirmation. What about confirmation, it is more elegant to show a modal instead a browser question box. Can you do those?
```

```
Wonder! But when the import process finished, a browser information box appeared. Is there a way to use a modal box like the one for questions?
```

```
Nice! Now I need a checkbox on confirmation box to accept my answare for future questions, but isolated for add and replace questions, can you implement this code, please?
```

```
Almost there! When a click on "Yes" to confirm to add or update, I got "Error importing file: Cannot access 'storedData' before initialization", can you analyse the code and fix this issue, please?
```

```
Please, replace JSON word with cards.
```

```
I need more this features: add in each article a field for storege the timestamp of last update, showing this information at bottom right of each card, with the same style of update button. This information is now for existents articles in data.json and data_pt-BR.json, and update this field when add or update a card, also a dropdown menu like "My cards" for order by title, newest or oldest. Can you add this for me, please?
```

```
Nice! But need a adjust, I need to see the time together date and this info above last article like, not at the same layer. Can you adjust please?
```

```
Sorry! I meant below not above, can you correct my mistake, please?
```

```
Actually, you want it to be in the bottom right corner of the card, just like the delete button is in the top right corner. Could you adjust that?
```

```
Hmmm... On some cases, timestamp overlay the link, so I think that card need a bottom pad to evict this. Can you correct this, please?
```
